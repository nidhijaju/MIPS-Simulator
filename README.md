# MIPS-Simulator
Implementation of MIPS CPU Simulator and Test bench

C++ implementation of 52 instructions from MIPS ISA. 

To compile and create an executable binary for simulator:
																														
	make simulator

To compile and create executable for testbench:

	make testbench

To test simulator and testbench together:

	bin/mips_testbench bin/mips_simulator 

This will run the simulator against all the tests. Ideal simulator passes all tests.
